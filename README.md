# Side-by-side video comparison tool

## Compare two videos running simultaneously in the same "window", with a slider to adjust the width of the compared videos.

> Useful for comparing the quality of different video coding formats/codecs.

### Setup 

1. Point to the video/image sources in index.html
2. Open index.html in your browser

> On Mac, MacOS High Sierra + Safari is required for web playback. 
> Note for h265 playback in Safari: As of 2017-08-18, the HEVC coding needs to be of type hvc1 and not hev1 (check with ffmpeg -i 'video.mp4').
> To encode from hev1 to hvc1: 

```
mp4box -raw 1 h265_hev.mp4
mp4box -add h265_hev_track1.hvc h265_hvc.mp4
```

### Shortcuts

| Action                    | Key          
| -------------             |:-------------
| Pause/Play video          | Space
| Show/hide video overlay   | i
| Jump to next frame *      | Right arrow 
| Jump to prev frame *      | Left arrow

> \* The frame jump functionality is based on a frame rate constant set in index.js, which might have to be changed for the functionality to work as expected.

### Known issues
* The two videos might fall out of sync during playback 

> Nothing is done to resync the videos during playback. Syncing is currently done when pausing, but may still take some time. Maybe needless to say, jumping to the next or previous frames also triggers syncing of the videos (and also pauses the videos).

* No progress bar or seek functionality

* Clip video on hover does not work with HLS-playlist

> Workaround is to click and drag to clip instead of only hovering.
